To suggest features and improvements that would be useful to the HVAC community, I’ll consider the context of your v2 codebase, which appears to be a web-based demo with AI-powered chat, customizable prompts, and a UI for HVAC-related interactions.

Here are some targeted suggestions for features and improvements that can add value for HVAC professionals, technicians, and end-users:

1. Fault Diagnosis & Troubleshooting Assistant
Integrate a module where users can describe HVAC symptoms (e.g., “AC not cooling”) and receive AI-driven troubleshooting steps.
Provide links to relevant documentation, videos, or manufacturer manuals.
2. Predictive Maintenance Recommendations
Allow users to log equipment details and receive AI-generated maintenance schedules or alerts based on usage patterns and common failure data.
3. Energy Consumption Analysis
Enable users to input or upload energy usage data (CSV, manual entry).
Offer AI-powered suggestions to optimize HVAC settings for energy savings.
4. Parts Lookup & Compatibility Checker
Integrate a searchable database for HVAC parts and components.
Allow users to check compatibility between parts and specific HVAC models.
5. Enhanced Preset Management
Let users create, edit, and share custom prompt presets tailored for specific HVAC scenarios (e.g., “Duct Sizing,” “Refrigerant Charging”).
Community-driven preset sharing and rating system.
6. Visual Aids & Diagram Generation
Generate wiring diagrams, airflow schematics, or duct layouts based on user input.
Support for uploading photos and getting AI feedback (e.g., “Is this wiring correct?”).
7. Regulatory Compliance Checker
Provide a tool to check if a proposed installation or repair meets local HVAC codes and standards.
8. Multi-language Support
Expand accessibility by adding support for multiple languages, especially Spanish, French, etc.
9. Mobile-Friendly & Offline Mode
Ensure the UI is fully responsive and consider a PWA (Progressive Web App) mode for offline access in the field.
10. Integration with IoT Devices
Allow users to connect and monitor smart thermostats or sensors, and get real-time AI insights.
11. Session History & Export
Save chat and diagnostic session history, with options to export as PDF or send via email for record-keeping.
12. User Roles & Permissions
Differentiate between homeowner, technician, and admin roles, customizing the UI and available features accordingly.
